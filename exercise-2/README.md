# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice writing and executing some basic R functions. Note, this exercise requires some knowledge of vectors, as described in [module-7](https://github.com/INFO-201/m7-vectors).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
